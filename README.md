# FMSec

In this course project, we developed two different key exchange protocols by a series of suc-
cessive (informal) refinement steps. The first protocol is Password-Authenticated Connection
Establishment (PACE), which is part of the protocol suite used for machine-readable travel
documents (e.g., e-passports) all over the world. The second protocol is the Off-the-Record
(OTR) protocol, which is used for secure messaging. 

The project received a total of 95 out of 110 points with some minor flaws and unprecise formulations found.

The project documentation was in form of a  `Lab Journal` and the precise assignment instructions can be found in the file `project.pdf`
